# 🔄 Release Migration Plan - Fussi Library

## 📋 **Migration Strategy**

### **Current Situation:**
- Package name changed from `com.example.fussi_lib` to `com.fussi.fussiLib`
- Need to mark old releases as pre-1.0 versions (0.x.x)
- Create new 1.0.0 release with proper package name

### **Migration Plan:**
1. **Rename existing releases** to 0.x.x versions
2. **Update local tags** to match
3. **Clean build** with new package name
4. **Create 1.0.0 release** as the official first release

## 🔄 **Step-by-Step Migration**

### **Step 1: Rename GitHub Releases**

**Current → New Mapping:**
- `v1.0.0` → `v0.1.0` (Initial release)
- `1.0.1` → `v0.1.1` (Bug fix)
- `v1.1.1` → `v0.2.0` (Minor features)
- `v1.1.2` → `v0.2.1` (Recent updates)

**Manual Steps (GitHub Web Interface):**
1. Go to: https://github.com/omd0/fussi_lib/releases
2. For each release, click "Edit"
3. Change tag name and release title
4. Update description to indicate it's a pre-1.0 version

### **Step 2: Update Local Git Tags**

```bash
# Delete old tags locally
git tag -d v1.0.0
git tag -d 1.0.1  
git tag -d v1.1.1
git tag -d v1.1.2

# Delete old tags on remote
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.1
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.1.1
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.1.2

# Create new tags for legacy releases
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Legacy release v0.1.0 (was v1.0.0) - Pre-package rename"
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Legacy release v0.1.1 (was 1.0.1) - Pre-package rename"
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Legacy release v0.2.0 (was v1.1.1) - Pre-package rename"
git tag -a v0.2.1 -m "Legacy release v0.2.1 (was v1.1.2) - Pre-package rename"

# Push new tags
git push origin v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.1
git push origin v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.1
```

### **Step 3: Clean and Build v1.0.0**

```bash
# Clean everything
flutter clean
rm -rf build/
rm -rf .dart_tool/

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build release assets
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release

# Copy to release directory
cp build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk release/fussi_library_v1.0.0.apk
cp build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab release/fussi_library_v1.0.0.aab
```

## 📞 **Manual Steps Required**

Since GitHub CLI seems to have issues, you'll need to manually rename releases:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/omd0/fussi_lib/releases
2. **For each release**, click "Edit release"
3. **Update** tag name and title according to mapping above
4. **Add note** about being a pre-1.0 legacy release

This ensures clean version history and proper semantic versioning going forward.
